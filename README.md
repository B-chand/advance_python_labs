# Lab 01: Introduction to Python Basics
**Subject:** Advanced Python for Data Science  

**Student Name:** Bibek Chand  
**Department:** BCT (III/I)  
**Roll No:** 05

## Objective
1. To understand basic data types in Python  
2. To learn loops and the `range()` function  
3. To understand mutable and immutable data types  
4. To use `input()` and type casting  
5. To define and use functions  

---

## Theory
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.  

**Mutable data types:** List, Dictionary, Set  
**Immutable data types:** int, float, string, tuple  

- `input()` always takes input as a string  
- Type casting is required for numerical operations  

---

## Explanation of Programs
- Created variables of different data types (`int`, `float`, `complex`, `list`, etc.)  
- Loops were used to iterate over lists  
- Demonstrated `range()` function  
- Used `input()` to take user input and `type()` to check data types  
- Demonstrated type casting from string to int  
- Defined a function to calculate the area of a rectangle

## Result
All programs executed successfully. Outputs were as expected for each section.

## Conclusion
This lab provides a strong foundation in Python programming and prepares for advanced topics in data science and backend development.
