## Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive exploration of linear regression, debugging, and outlier detection using Python. The objective is to gain practical experience with statistical modeling, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Through hands-on exercises, we fit regression models, interpret their results, and apply EDA techniques to understand data distributions and detect anomalies. The lab emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and professional presentation.

## Objectives

- Understand linear regression concepts
- Fit a model using Statsmodels (OLS)
- Interpret regression results
- Debug common issues
- Perform EDA & outlier detection

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Load and Inspect Data
- Import required libraries
- Load dataset using Pandas
- Display first 5 rows
- Check data types, missing values, summary statistics

### Task 2: Data Cleaning
- Rename columns for clarity

### Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Create scatterplot, regression plot, histograms, and boxplots

### Task 4: Fit Linear Regression (Statsmodels OLS)
- Fit model and display summary

### Task 5: Model Interpretation
- Explain R-squared, coefficients, p-value, F-statistic

### Task 6: Debugging Exercise
- Debug provided notebook
